# Job configuration
jobs:
  # Job name: test
  test:
    # Operating virtual machine environment (ubuntu-latest has the best compatibility)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps: operations executed in sequence
    steps:
      # Step 1: Pull repository code (GitHub official action)
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Python environment (specify compatible versions, keep 3.11 here, or extend to multiple versions)
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11]  # To support multiple versions, change to ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11"] (array format)
          # Cache dependencies to speed up subsequent runs (enabled to avoid re-downloading dependencies)
          cache: "pip"

      # Step 3: Install dependencies (optimize commands and add fault tolerance)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          # Install code linting and testing frameworks, add --quiet to reduce redundant output
          pip install --quiet flake8 pytest
          # Install dependencies from requirements.txt if it exists, otherwise skip
          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install --quiet -r requirements.txt; fi

      # Step 4: Code linting (flake8 checks for syntax and code style errors)
      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: |
          # Stop build if there are syntax errors (E) or logical errors (F)
          flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
          # Count warnings (W) and info (I), do not stop build (relax style checks for test code)
          flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

      # Step 5: Run automated tests (pytest)
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: |
          # Skip testing if tests directory does not exist (avoid workflow failure when test code is not written)
          if [ -d tests/ ]; then pytest tests/ -v; else echo "Tests directory not found, skip testing"; fi
